# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PedroEduardoSS
### Who am I
My name is Pedro Eduardo.

I've been studying and improving my programming skills since 2018 with technologies such as Python, JS/TS, PHP, SQL, and GIT.

The main web frameworks I'm familiar with are:
 - Django
 - Laravel
 - Flask
 - and FastAPI.

I'm very interested in technology, focusing on cybersecurity, software testing, data analysis, machine learning, and back-end development.

I'm currently developing new independent projects and seeking opportunities.

I can offer the following services:
1. Testing your software (QA, automated tests)
2. Developing data-driven solutions (data analysis, ETL with Airflow)
3. Developing automation scripts (web scraping, testing bots, task automation, GitHub actions)
4. Web development or APIs (depending on the business)
